Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This creates a directory containing information that allows git to identify
the folder as a git repository. The contents of the .git file that is created 
is modified for each commit to create a navigatable history of changes to the 
repository.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to choose which files to commit to the repo. If 
there were no intermediate staging area then every commit would be a complete
copy of the working directory, and the user would have no control.
