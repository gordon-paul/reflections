Q. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When multiple users are working on a project or when accessing a project from multiple machines.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This prevents the code you are working on requiring merging whenever anyone pushes changes to the repository.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks - Create a copy of an existing repository on your GitHub profile.

Clone - Create a copy of an existing repository on a local machine.

Branch - Create a copy of a local repository to work on. Usually temporary.

Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Awareness of the most recent changes made by co-workers, which might influence the work you are doing.
